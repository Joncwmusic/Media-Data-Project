# I Have No Idea What This Will Become

### and that's okay

## What am I doing?

I am currently compiling data getting some practice sorting some data directly from APIs. Spotify, tmdb, genius, 
have free APIs with some rate limits and I figure it'd be cool to compile what I can get from each of these data sources and then some.

## What Have I done so far?

So Far, I've done the following:

- Started getting Spotify ingestion functions working
- Started getting tmdb ingestion functions working
- Added an "is this band emo" function for fun
- Working through Genius Ingestion

## What do I want to add?

- I'm thinking about adding LLM integration with the lyrics from genius
- I'd like to consider trending/top artists/top actor data from another data source
- Storage will become a factor soon and transforming everything into something structured would be cool
- Canva API for a newsletter format? Sounds like an idea for how to use whatever data I gather.
- Tracking over time by importing everything into a sqlite db and getting changes in data since the only reliable source for historical data is songstats.

## What it looks like so far:
